# FullstackFT  

Couple of Notes for the Project:  
* The backend used a mLab,  that is a online service for hosting a MongoDB
* The Backend and Frontend are speperated, and will be be running on two seperate ports, and because of that the REST API, 
has allowed cross origin
* To test the backend make sure to start the backend first using npm start in one ternimal and npm test in another
* There is no frontend implementation of create a shop product or changing a status of a product, but the backend supports that
